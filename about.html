                    <p>There is so much beauty in the Philippines. We people just tend to forget it. We sometimes ignore what is in front of us. <br> Why do we have to travel to different countries, when we have 7,641 amazing and captivating islands to choose from?</p>
                    <p>The problem is we have this wrong misconception that travelling within our country can really be expensive. That it is more cheaper to travel to our neighboring countries such as Thailand, HongKong, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>We are here to bring awareness that the Philippines is still the best place to travel. We will show you the cheapest places to go to. What is the latest food craze. The hottest vacation spot that most people doesn't fully know about. And more exciting new places to discover.</p>
                    <p><b>PerlWat</b> will also shed some light about business and investment opportunities from all the 3 island group of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Anything can happen... you can have a business partner in Guimaras on producing quality export dried mangoes. Or have a Beef Tapa jerky business in Manila from the islands of Masbate. How about building an Eco-Themed Resort in coordination with the Parrot Conservatory group in Palawan? <br> Anything is possible and can be within your reach.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly, you get to know different people from different walks of life from the 17 regions, 81 provinces, 145 cities, 1,489 municipalities, and 42,036 barangays. Get to know them in person. The place that they are living in. Their culture and way of life.       <br> Filipinos are known for having the most kindest of hearts. What better way than reaching out to them and find a deeper perspective and meaning. </p>
                    <p><b>PerlWat</b> is a community-driven platform where it's main objective is not only to give awareness to our fellow Filipinos on how beautiful our country is, but also to unite as all and help each other in protecting our motherland. Thus, making our place a much better place to live in.</p>
